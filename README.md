# twin_model_GPLDA
Twin Model GPLDA for short duration speaker verification
The scripts follow the format of MSR (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/msr-identity-toolbox-v1-0-a-matlab-toolbox-for-speaker-recognition-research-2/).
1. Twin_model_gplda_em.m is to train a Twin Model GPLDA
2. score_twin_model_gplda_trials.m is for scoring
